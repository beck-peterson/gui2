        <p>Untoward and illegitimate breeding operations lure dog owners from proper breeding channels. Puppy mills have led to an abundance in unadopted, ownerless offspring.
        Canine Connection strives to remove mystery from the breeding process by requiring necessary information of a purchased or partnered dog.
        By revealing the reputations of the owner/breeder as evaluated by previous clients, we can create a transparent community between owner and breeder.
        By requiring pedigree, age, health and other fields impactful to litter. It will be made transparent to users browsing for the next parent of the newest member of the family.
        <br><br>
        What's the problem right now?<br>
        Breeders are lacking legitimate documentation that promotes health risks and unanticipated breed mixing. Our own experiences in breeding have revealed the absence of a consolidated portal to answer such concerns.  , pressuring owners to travel to prospective breeders before a deal is broken. Our mission with Canine Connection is to reduce puppy farm business and the lack of transparency social media marketplaces facilitate for illegitimate breeders. By offering a straightforward
        breeding experience we will slowly erase the inhumane puppy mill operations and misleading marketplace offers.
        <br><br>
        What's special about Canine Connection?<br>
        Existing, similar services focus are concerned with listing dog profiles from stores and shelters - Petfinder.com, GetPet, etc. Others focus solely on showcasing professional breeders and their businesses - Gespet, Perfect Dog, etc. Canine connection is an intersection of both types of services.
